# ArmoredCore6SaveTransferTool
This tool transfers save to a new SteamId modified to work within the Electron environment and rewritten in Javascript. 

# How To Use
* Put the save you want to transfer into your `%appdata%/ArmoredCore6/YourSteamId/` folder
* Drag and drop the save file onto `ArmoredCore6SaveTransferTool.exe`.
* If you drag and drop it from any other location, it will ask for the new steam id.
* Launch the game.
